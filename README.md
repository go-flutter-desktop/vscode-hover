# VS Code Extension for Hover

Experimental VSCode Extension for Hover.

After installing this extension from the marketplace you can `Hover: Run` from the command palette. The extension will execute `hover run` and attaches the Flutter Debugger.

Please file issues or requests at the [go-flutter issue tracker](https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/go-flutter/issues).

## Running the Extension

- Run `npm install` in terminal to install dependencies
- Run the `Run Extension` target in the Debug View. This will:
	- Start a task `npm: watch` to compile the code
	- Run the extension in a new VS Code window
